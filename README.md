# DTHLabs Framework
Personal implementation of what's known as  MVC style framework. I made this to improve my coding abilities ,but o also think outside the box and not be bound to jsut popular frameworks. Yes Laravel and other are better, but I believe into something that's built simple and robust, this is why I made this. Feel free to use it, improve and so on. It's fast, easy to use and can support a ton of features.
