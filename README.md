# DTHLabs Framework
Personal implementation of a pure MVC style framework. Uses a lot of popular features
such as Eloquent, Doctrine,Meta and so on. I put it together for my own projects as I don't like to be 
bound to any limits. I extended a lot of te functionality myself.
It's fast, easy to use and can support a ton of features.
