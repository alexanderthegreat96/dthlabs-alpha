# DTHLabs Framework
Personal implementation of what's known as  MVC style framework. 
I made this to improve my coding abilities ,
but o also think outside the box and not be bound to just popular frameworks.
Yes Laravel and other are better, but I believe into something that's built simple 
and robust, this is why I made this. 
Feel free to use it, improve and so on. 
It's fast, easy to use and can support a ton of features.

# Removed docs 

If you want to use it , just head over to app and explore a little bit.

This Framework was made for my own internal projects. I sampled the software I ussually use
as I do not like to get bloated by popular frameworks.
