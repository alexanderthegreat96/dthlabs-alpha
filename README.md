# DTHLabs Framework
Personal implementation of what's known as  MVC style framework. 
I made this to improve my coding abilities ,
but o also think outside the box and not be bound to just popular frameworks.
Yes Laravel and other are better, but I believe into something that's built simple 
and robust, this is why I made this. 
Feel free to use it, improve and so on. 
It's fast, easy to use and can support a ton of features.

# Removed docs 

If you want to use it , just head over to app and explore a little bit.
Or send me an email alexandrulupaescu[at]gmail.com.

This Framework was made for my own internal projects. I sampled the software I ussually use
as I do not like to get bloated by popular frameworks.

Head over to:
- app/Controller
- app/Model
- app/Middleware
- resources/views
- resources/ajax-callbacks
- resources/media
- resources/css
- resources/js
- core/Libs
- core/Packages

- core/SystemDependencies
- app/routes.php


Features:
 - BladeOne templateing engine
 - Fast Routing 
 - Easy to use and deploy
 - Decently Secure
 - Has a built in package manager to implement packages
 - 2 Hour learning curve
